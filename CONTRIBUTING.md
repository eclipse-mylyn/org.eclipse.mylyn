Also add your GitHub account name to your [Eclipse account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/) under social media links section
to enable automated management of access rights for Eclipse project members.

### Commit message recommendations

  \<issue title\> \#\<issue number\>
  
  Example: The eclipse-test-framework deliverable contains unsigned bundles \#32
  
  Again this is a recommendation on the issue title part. Instead of issue title, if needed provide a concise description of changes.
