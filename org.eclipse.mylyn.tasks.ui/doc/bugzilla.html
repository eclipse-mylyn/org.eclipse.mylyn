    <h2>
      Bugzilla Client Integration</h2>
			Bug reports can be opened with either the Bug Editor or the Internal 
			Web Browser.&nbsp; This can be set as a Task List preferences.&nbsp; 
			When the Bug Editor is open you can click the hyperlink to show the 
			report in the browser (e.g. to use a feature not yet available in 
			the editor, such as voting).&nbsp; <p>
			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/bugzilla-internal-browser.gif" width="344" height="157"></p>All bug reports are archived 
			in a special category that is invisible by default.&nbsp; But if a 
			you do a search, and the matches don't show in another category 
			(e.g. because no query matches that report), the archive category, 
			highlighted in blue below, gives access to that report.<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/tasks-archive.gif" width="331" height="187"><p>If a bug report has information on it that has not been viewed, such 
			as new comments, the blue &quot;incoming&quot; overlay is displayed.&nbsp; If 
			a bug has changes on it that have been saved but have not been 
			committed to Bugzilla, the gray &quot;outgoing&quot; overlay is displayed.&nbsp; 
			A red overlay appears if there is a conflict.</p>

			<img border="0" src="../../org.eclipse.mylar.doc/doc/images/bugzilla-synch.gif" width="323" height="186"></p>To create a custom Bugzilla query paste the query URL into the New 
			Bugzilla Query dialog. This enables support of queries that can not 
			be configured via the dialog, and as such some query hits may not 
			open or format properly.<p>

			You can explicitly state 
			whether you want to work with cached copies of Bugzilla reports and 
			avoid refresh with the server.&nbsp; In offline mode the cached bug 
			copy is always used.&nbsp; In online mode the Bugzilla server is 
			always checked for the latest report.<p>
