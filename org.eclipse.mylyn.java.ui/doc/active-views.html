<h2>Active Views</h2>As you work and elements become landmarks 
			(bold decoration), Active Search eagerly finds related elements.&nbsp; 
			To force an element to populate the Active Search view manually make 
			it a landmark by right-clicking or hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up Arrow.&nbsp; 
			Use the pull-downs on the toolbar to alter the degree-of-separation 
			scope of the search.&nbsp; Note that elements with predicted 
			interest are gray.<p>

			finds and presents the type hierarchy of the current set of 
			landmarks.</p>
