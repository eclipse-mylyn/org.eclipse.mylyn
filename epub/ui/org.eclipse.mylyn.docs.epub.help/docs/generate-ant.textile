h1. Generate EPUB using Ant

p. Using the **epub** Ant task one can assemble an EPUB during continuous building or from within Eclipse. The example below shows a complete minimum Ant script.

bc. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project name="Build an EPUB" default="build">
  <target name="build">
    <epub file="My Book.epub">
      <title>My Book</title>
      <subject>My Book's subject</subject>
      <item file="my_chapter.xhtml" />
    </epub>
  </target>
</project>

p. In this example only some of the required properties have been specified, the rest will be automatically added. See the comprehensive description of the "epub":epub-ant-task.html Ant task for details. A more complete example is found in the "examples":examples.html chapter.
