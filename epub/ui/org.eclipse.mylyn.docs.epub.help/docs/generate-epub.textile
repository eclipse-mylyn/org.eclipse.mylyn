h1. Generate EPUB directly from markup

p. Lightweight wikitext markup can easily be converted into EPUBs. From within Eclipse right click on any supported markup file (ending in @*.textile@, @*.mediawiki@ etc), then select **Wikitext > Generate EPUB** from the context menu. This will bring up a wizard as illustrated below.

In addition to those that are already filled in you will have to enter a **title**, **language** and **subject**. Required properties are marked with an asterisk.
