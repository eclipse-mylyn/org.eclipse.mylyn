h1. Overview

This guide provides basic instructions on the use of WikiText.  
WikiText provides extensions to the Mylyn task editor supporting "lightweight markup languages":http://www.wikipedia.com/Lightweight_Markup such as Textile and MediaWiki.  WikiText also provides a wiki text editor for Eclipse and Ant tasks for converting lightweight markup to HTML and other formats.

For information about integrating your application with WikiText please see the *WikiText Developer Guide*.

h2. Table of Contents

{toc}

h1. Getting Started

The WikiText plug-in provides a lightweight markup editor for Eclipse.  The editor is registered against all files with the following file extensions: @*.textile@, @*.tracwiki@, @*.mediawiki@, @*.twiki@, @*.confluence@

It's also possible to register the editor with other file extensions by setting the Eclipse preferences under ==<b>General-&gt;Other-&gt;File Associations</b>==.

h2. Creating A New File

Using the new file wizard, choose ==<b>New-&gt;File</b>==, or ==<b>New-&gt;Other...-&gt;General-&gt;File</b>==.  In the
filename field, enter the name of the file with a @.textile@ or other registered extension.  

When the new file is created it should open in the WikiText editor.  Start typing!!

h2. WikiText Editor Overview

The WikiText editor provides a source view, preview and outline.

!images/editor-overview.png!

The editor has tabs on the bottom that facilitate switching to and from 'Source' and 'Preview'.

!images/editor-tabs.png!

h3. Markup Source Tab

'Source' is the default editor pane.  This is the area for editing markup such as Textile.   The source pane provides syntax highlighting that should make it easier to see what the markup means.

Standard text editor actions are available here, such as copy/paste and find/replace.  Explore the context menu and 'Edit' menu to see what actions are available.

h3. Preview Tab

The editor preview provides a preview of the wiki markup as it is rendered by your default browser after converting the markup to HTML.  Though the 'Source' syntax highlighting is pretty good, the preview provides a more accurate view of the rendered result.

h3. Outline

The editor outline provides a structured view of the markup source.  Headings in the markup are used to provide a 'Table of Contents'.  

!images/editor-outline.png!

Clicking on an item in the outline will show the corresponding header in the source, and navigating in the source will cause the most relevant item in the outline to be selected.

Note that clicking on an item in the outline has no effect if the editor preview is showing.

h2. Switching Markup Languages

The WikiText editor supports multiple markup languages.  The editor makes a best-guess at the markup language from the file extension.  To switch markup languages in the editor invoke the context menu *Markup Languages* and select the language:

!images/editor-switch-language.png!

The editor will remember your selection the next time the same file is opened.

h2. Accessing the Markup Cheat-Sheet

The editor provides a markup 'cheat-sheet'.  The cheat-sheet is a quick-reference for markup syntax.  To access the cheat-sheet press *F1* in the source view of the editor.

Note that the content of the cheat-sheet will vary according to the markup language being displayed. 

!images/editor-cheat-sheet.png!

h1. Task Editor Integration

WikiText extends Mylyn to provide a markup-aware task editor.  With WikiText installed, Mylyn can render wiki markup as intended, provide markup-specific syntax highlighting, content-assist, validation, and a cheat-sheet for wiki markup syntax.

h2. Repository Configuration

To use the WikiText extension to the Mylyn task editor you may need to configure your Mylyn task repository.  To do so, open the Mylyn *Task Repositories* view (==<b>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other...-&gt;Mylyn-&gt;Task Repositories</b>==).  Select the repository that you wish to configure and then select *Properties* from the context menu.

!images/repository-settings-task-editor-extension.png!

In the *Editor* section select the markup language of choice.  Note that you may need to expand this section to see available choices.  To disable WikiText extensions to the Mylyn task editor select *Plain Text*. 

Press the *Finish* button when you've finished to make the changes permanent.  Note that changes to these settings will only be visible for newly opened task editors.  Task editors that were open prior to making the changes will need to be closed and reopened for the settings to take effect.

h1. Markup Conversion

Lightweight markup is designed to be readily converted to HTML.  WikiText provides a means to convert markup to:

* HTML
* "DocBook":http://www.docbook.org
* "OASIS DITA":http://dita.xml.org
* Eclipse help format (HTML and @toc.xml@)

h2. Conversion In Eclipse

These conversions can be made by right-clicking any @*.textile@, @*.tracwiki@, @*.mediawiki@, @*.twiki@, or @*.confluence@ resource in the Eclipse UI: 

!images/resource-conversion-menu.png!

Performing a conversion from the UI will cause corresponding files (@*.xml@, @*.html@, @*-toc.xml@) to be created in the same folder as the selected file(s).

More control over the conversion process can be achieved by using Ant build scripts (described below).

h2. Conversion using Ant build scripts

"Ant":http://www.apache.org build scripts may also be used to drive a markup conversion.  The following is an example of how to drive conversion from Textile markup to Eclipse help format (to HTML and toc.xml):

bc.. 
	<property name="wikitext.standalone" value=""/><!-- path to wikitext standalone package -->

	<path id="wikitext.classpath">
		<fileset dir="${wikitext.standalone}">
			<include name="org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.*core*.jar"/>
		</fileset>
	</path>

	<taskdef classpathref="wikitext.classpath" resource="org/eclipse/mylyn/wikitext/core/util/anttask/tasks.properties" />
	
	<target name="generate-help" depends="init" description="Generate Eclipse help from textile source">
		<wikitext-to-eclipse-help markupLanguage="Textile" 
			multipleOutputFiles="true"
			navigationImages="true">
			<fileset dir="${basedir}">
    				<include name="help/*.textile"/>
			</fileset>
			<stylesheet url="styles/help.css"/>
			<stylesheet url="styles/main.css"/>
		</wikitext-to-eclipse-help>
	</target>

p. Similar Ant scripts can be used to convert to HTML:

bc. 	
	<target name="generate-html" depends="init" description="Generate HTML from textile source">
		<wikitext-to-html markupLanguage="Textile">
			<fileset dir="${basedir}">
    				<include name="help/*.textile"/>
			</fileset>
			<stylesheet url="styles/main.css"/>
		</wikitext-to-html>
	</target>

Conversion using Ant is used by the WikiText project to create help content.  We find that writing help content in Textile markup is much easier than writing DocBook or HTML.

The @<stylesheet>@ entries in the above examples are optional; these cause an HTML link to one or more stylesheets to be added to the head of the generated HTML document.

The @markupLanguage@ attribute accepts any of the following values (depending on your classpath):

* @Textile@
* @MediaWiki@
* @TracWiki@
* @TWiki@
* @Confluence@
* A fully-qualified class name of a class that extends @org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core.parser.markup.MarkupLanguage@


*common task options* 

|_. Option |_. Usage |
| @markupLanguage@ | The markup language to use, for example 'Textile', 'Confluence', 'MediaWiki', 'TracWiki', 'TWiki'. |
| @validate@ | Indicate if the input file should be validated. |
| @failOnValidationError@ | @true@ or @false@, default is true.  Indicate if validation errors should cause a build failure. |
| @failOnValidationWarning@ | @true@ or @false@, default is false.  Indicate if validation warnings should cause a build failure. |

h3. DocBook

WikiText can convert markup to "DocBook":http://www.docbook.org

bc. 
	<wikitext-to-docbook markupLanguage="Textile">
		<fileset dir="${textile.root.dir}">
 			<include name="**/*.textile"/>
		</fileset>
	</wikitext-to-docbook>

You can use WikiText first to convert your Textile markup to "DocBook":http://www.docbook.org then use the "DocBook XSL stylesheets":http://docbook.sourceforge.net/ to convert the DocBook to Eclpse help content, HTML, pdf or other formats.  For more information on using the DocBook XSL stylesheets please refer to the "DocBook XSL project":http://docbook.sourceforge.net/

h3. DITA

WikiText can convert markup to "OASIS DITA":http://dita.xml.org.  The conversion can either be used to convert a single input file to a bookmap and multiple topics, or to a single topic.

WikiText conversion to DITA is performed using the @wikitext-to-dita@ task.  In addition to common options listed above, the following options are available:

*wikitext-to-dita task options* 

|_. Option |_. Usage |
| @bookTitle@ | Specify a specific book title.  If unspecified, the book title is the filename of the source file (without extension). |
| @overwrite@ | @true@ or @false@, default is true.  Indicate if existing target files should be overwritten even if they are newer than the source file. |
| @file@ | the source file.  Optional, not required if a fileset is specified. |
| @doctype@ | Optional.  Overrides the DTD doctype to use in the target bookmap. |
| @topicDoctype@ | Optional.  Overrides the DTD doctype to use in the target topic files. |
| @topicFolder@ | Optional, defaults to 'topics'.  The relative folder name to use for topic files when producing multiple output files. |
| @topicStrategy@ | Optional, defaults to 'FIRST'.  Must be one of 'FIRST', 'LEVEL1' or 'NONE'.  Specify how multiple output files are generated.  'FIRST' indicates that multiple topic files are to be created, split at the level of the first heading encountered in the file.  'LEVEL1' indicates that multiple topic files are to be created, split one file for each level-1 heading encountered.  'NONE' indicates that multiple topic files are not to be created.  Only a single topic file is created, with no bookmap. |

h4. wikitext-to-dita - Multiple Files Example

To convert an input file to a bookmap and multiple topics, use the following:

bc. 
	<wikitext-to-dita markupLanguage="Textile">
		<fileset dir="help" includes="**/*.textile"/>
	</wikitext-to-dita>

The output is created as multiple files: a bookmap and multiple topics, one topic for every level-1 heading.

h4. wikitext-to-dita - Single Output File Example

To convert an input file to a single output file, use the following:

bc. 
	<wikitext-to-dita markupLanguage="Textile"
		topicStrategy="NONE">
		<fileset dir="help" includes="**/*.textile"/>
	</wikitext-to-dita>

h2. Ant Examples

See "the examples":examples for example Ant build scripts.

h1. Textile Syntax

The WikiText editor supports most standard Textile markup.  In addition some markup extensions are supported.  See the markup 'cheat-sheet' for details (press *F1* in the editor).

h2. Textile Syntax Tips

h3. Whitespace

Textile markup is sensitive to whitespace.  For example, a line that starts with '@{color:blue;}h1.@' is only a heading if the '@{color:blue;}h1.@' is immediately followed by a space character.  This can bite you if you're not careful!  

A less obvious example of the same problem is with '@{color:blue;}bc.@'  Usually content in a 'block code' section is on the line following the '@{color:blue;}bc.@'  If the '@{color:blue;}bc.@' is not immediately followed by a space character _before the end of the line_, then the area is simply considered a normal paragraph.

h3. HTML Literals

Textile markup can handle literal HTML.  For example, the following is valid Textile:

bc. 
some <b>bold text</b> here

Care must be taken with literal HTML: the start tag must be completed on one line, and the end tag must be completed on one line.  The following is an example of embedded HTML that won't work with Textile:

bc. 
here is <a
href="#">a bad example</a>

The above example can be fixed by moving the @href@ up on to the same line as the @<a@ portion:

bc. 
here is <a href="#">a working example</a>

h3. Images and DocBook

When handling images in a conversion of Textile markup to DocBook markup, there are several choices for the resulting DocBook markup.  By default images are converted as follows:

bc. 
!images/foo.png!

results in:

bc. 
<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref=\"images/foo.png\"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

@<mediaobject/>@ is useful for some cases, however there are times when @<inlinemediaobject/>@ should be used instead.  To achieve this result, add the @inline@ class to your image as follows:

bc. 
!(inline)images/foo.png!

The conversion will then result in the following:

bc. 
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref=\"images/foo.png\"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>

This document was written in Textile markup.  The original source code for this document "is available here":http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.mylyn/sandbox/org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.ui/help/Mylyn%20WikiText%20User%20Guide.textile?root=Tools_Project&view=markup

h1. Tips and Tricks

h2. Hot-Keys

To get a pop-up showing the list of available hot-keys and commands, press *CTRL+SHIFT+l* (or *COMMAND+SHIFT+l* on a mac)

!images/editor-command-help.png!

h2. Word Completion

Word completion is available from within the Textile editor.  Press *CTRL+.* (that is CTRL + '.', the dot character) repeatedly to see available completions from the current cursor position.

Word completion is based on the "Hippie":http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/packages/html/edit-utils_23.html algorithm, which finds existing words in the editing context and uses them to create completion proposals.

h2. Spelling

Spell checking is enabled by default in the Textile editor.  Pressing *CTRL+1* on a spelling issue will provide options for dealing with the spelling problem.

!images/editor-spelling.png!

h2. Content Assist

Content assist is available by pressing *CTRL+SPACE*.  Content assist will make suggestions based on the cursor position.  If only one proposal is available at the cursor position, the content will be filled in automatically, otherwise a list of proposals is shown.

Continued typing while the proposals are displayed will narrow the list of available choices.  A selection can be made with the mouse, or by using the up/down arrows and the enter key.

!images/editor-assist-proposals.png!

h3. Template-Based Content Assist

Content assist may also make proposals involving templates with variables.

!images/editor-assist-template-proposal-selection.png!

When such a proposal is selected the variables are displayed with a surrounding box.  Typing replaces the variable content, the *TAB* key advances to the next variable position, and the *ENTER* or *ESC* keys complete the template editing session.  The vertical line displayed at the end of the template shows where the cursor will be located when finished.

!images/editor-assist-template-proposal.png!

Note that while editing a template the standard undo/redo functionality is still available to you.

h3. Selection and Content Assist

Content assist may be invoked with selected text.  To do so, select text using the mouse or keyboard, and then press *CTRL+SPACE*.  Content assist is activated with the current selection.

Selecting a template-based content proposal will cause the selected text to be included in the template.  The following shows a selection and content assist proposals before selecting a proposal:

!images/editor-assist-selection-proposal.png!

The following shows the same text after selecting a proposal:

!images/editor-assist-selection-proposal-completed.png!

The selected text in this case is wrapped in '*' characters for the 'strong' Textile markup.

h1. Preferences

WikiText editor preferences may be configured via the Eclipse preferences dialog.  CSS styles are used to modify the markup syntax highlighting in the editor:

!images/editor-preferences.png!

The following CSS styles are recognized:

| @color@ | named or rgb(r,g,b) |
| @background-color@ | named or rgb(r,g,b) |
| @font-family@ | monospace, courier, courier new |
| @font-style@ | italic, bold, normal |
| @font-weight@ | bold, bolder, normal, lighter |
| @font-size@ | percentage, named size, or absolute size (pt or px) |
| @text-decoration@ | none, line-through, underline |
| @vertical-align@ | super, sub |
